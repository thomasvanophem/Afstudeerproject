Afstudeer Project UvA - Graphical geography-based selection of news items

Problem statement:

Usually news items are presented as text around a specific topic, and an observer will infer the location from the text. Likewise, search engines are topic- or keyword-based: there are currently no mechanisms to find news items related to a specific location on Earth. For example, one can find news about the events in Kiev by using both “Kiev” and “Ukraine” as search terms. In contrast, to answer “What is currently happening around the Black Sea?” one must search separately for keywords related to Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania. This limits the understanding of news by the public, because the high-level strategic significance of news is often related to large geographical features which are not directly represented by country borders or local keywords. A need thus exists to geolocate news feeds and enable geography-based selection of news items.

Project description:

The project should aim at providing an Earth map with a “live” representation of news items as positions on the map. The proposed solution should integrate a map visualization tool, “news feeds” from various sources (for example online newspapers, Bing and Google News) and a text recognition algorithm able to recognize place names in the text and look them up in geolocation databases. The user should be able to select a region on Earth and time period, and see a list of URLs to news items for that region and period.
